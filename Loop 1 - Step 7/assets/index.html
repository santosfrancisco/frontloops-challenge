          The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite
          sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even
          though most people don't take the time to find someone
          who truly respects them. It seems like people are just
          looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of
          attention, setting for something much les than respect. I
          am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship
          grow is by showing respect.

          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be
          respected. What is respect? Respect is showing someone
          extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to
          show them how highly they are valued.
